<h4><u>URL(UNIFORM RESOURCE LOCATOR):</u></h4>
<p>URL (uniform resource locator) it is the address used to access the resource address.
The structure of URL is divided into three classes they are:</p>
<p>1.protocol</p>
 <p>2.Domain</p>
<p>3.path</p>
<h3><u>1.Protocol</u></h3>
<p> It is the set guidelines or rules helps us to display the data over the internet.
There are different types in protocol mainly:
</p>
<p>1.http</p>
<p>2.https</p>

<h3><u>2.Domain</u></h3>
<p> Domain make it easy for users to access websites without needing to remember IP addresses.</p>
<p><b>EX:</b>www.amazon.com</p>
<h3><u>3.Path</u></h3>
<p>The Path specifies the location of the resource on the server.</p>
<p><b>EX:</b>login? In www.amazon.com/login?</p>

<h4><u>AZILE METHODOLOGY</u></h4>
<p>The azile methodolgy is used in every software company for higher efficiency because it conatins some methodology that is:</P>
<p>The project is firstly divided into subparts called as <B><U>SPRINTS.</U></B> </p>
<P>1.In first method they will divide the projects into sprints and they will assign that sprints to the developers. </P>
<p>2.And they will schedule the time to the developers such as 2 to 3 weeks.</p>
<p>3.While we are doing the sprint we will get <b><u>SCRUM CALL</u></b> it means they will clarify doubts and they will track the sprint and they will clear if we have any problems in the sprint.The scrum call will be managed by <b><u>SCRUM MASTER.</b></u></p>
<p>4.After completion of sprint it will go to testing department .The Testing department will test if it is approved by the Testing department they will move to <b><u> sprint 2.</u></b> </P>
<p>5.If it is not approved then again it will go to sprint 1.</p>
<h4><u>WATERFALL METHODOLOGY</u></h4>
<p>1.The Waterfall methodology is a traditional, linear project management approach often used in software development and other industries.</p>
<p> 2.It is characterized by a sequential design process, where each phase of the project must be completed before moving on to the next.</p>
<p> 3.The method is structured and often used when the project requirements are well understood and unlikely to change significantly during development.</p>
<h4><u>SDLC (SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE)</u></h4>
<p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process that consists of several stages for developing software:</p>
<ol>

<li>REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS</li>
<li>PLANNING</li>
<li>SYSTEM DESIGN</li>
<li>IMPLEMENTATION</li>
<li>TESTING</li>
<li>DEPLOYMENT</li>
<li>MAINTAINANCE</li>

</ol>

<h4><u>DEVOPS</u></h4>
<p>1.These team is going to manage <u> upscaling</u> and <u>downscaling.</u></p>
<p>2.These team is going to provide security to the data. </p>
<p>3.These team is going to manage deployment and maintainance part after development of project.</p>
